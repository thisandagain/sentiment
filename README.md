## sentiment
#### AFINN-based sentiment analysis for Node.js

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thisandagain/sentiment.png)](http://travis-ci.org/thisandagain/sentiment)

Sentiment is a Node.js module that uses the [AFINN-111](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010) wordlist to perform [sentiment analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) on arbitrary blocks of input text. Sentiment provides serveral things:
- A fully async interface for performing sentiment analysis
- A build process that makes updating sentiment to future versions of the AFINN word list trivial
- Performance (see benchmarks below)

### Installation
```bash
npm install sentiment
```

### Usage
```javascript
var sentiment = require('sentiment');

sentiment('Cats are stupid.', function (err, result) {
    console.dir(result);    // Score: -2, Comparative: -0.666
});

sentiment('Cats are totally amazing!', function (err, result) {
    console.dir(result);    // Score: 4, Comparative: 1
});
```

### Testing
```bash
npm test
```

### Benchmarks
The primary motivation for designing `sentiment` was performance. As such, `sentiment` includes a benchmark script within the test directory that compares it against the [Sentimental](https://github.com/thinkroth/Sentimental) module which provides a nearly equivalent interface and approach. Based on these benchmarks running on an older MacBook Air with Node 0.8.9, `sentiment` is about 33 times faster than the alternative implementation:
